# Recursions, Loops and Compiler Optimizations

## Contents

## Loops and Recursion are different, right?

## All Recursions are not created equal

Two kinds of Recursions:

1. Iterative Recursions
    1. Peano Numbers as example
2. Recursive Recursions
    1. factorial as example

(lambda calculus has loops only through recursion)

## How Recursions and Loops actually work

(Overview of how they are represented in assembly and why they thus work on a computer)

## Compilers are clever
